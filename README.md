# 🛠️ Customer Management System Web Application

**Developer:** Akshitha  

**Objective:**  
The objective of this project is to build a web-based Customer Management System that allows a business or seller to manage their customers, orders, returns, complaints, feedback, and various analytics in one place. The system provides interactive dashboards, secure login, and modern UI to simulate a real-world business management tool.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project helped me build a complete Customer Management System using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **MySQL**. I designed this application to handle real-life needs like managing customers, orders, returns, feedback, and tracking overall business performance — all from one simple dashboard.

While working on it, I tried to include features that are usually found in modern business tools — like login authentication, customer lifetime value, return logic, dashboards, payment simulation, and even WhatsApp support. Some parts are kept manual (like delivery status) because this is a project, not a live business with real delivery systems.

This project not only helped me improve my technical skills but also gave me confidence to think like a real developer — how users interact, what data they need, and how to make the interface simple and useful. I also learned how important user experience and design are in making a project easy to use.

Overall, I really enjoyed building this system, and I believe it’s a strong example of what I’ve learned so far in my training.
