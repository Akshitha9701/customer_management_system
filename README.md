# üõ†Ô∏è Customer Management System Web Application

**Developer:** Akshitha  

**Objective:**  
The objective of this project is to build a web-based Customer Management System that allows a business or seller to manage their customers, orders, returns, complaints, feedback, and various analytics in one place. The system provides interactive dashboards, secure login, and modern UI to simulate a real-world business management tool.

## üèÅ Conclusion
This project helped me build a complete Customer Management System using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **MySQL**. I designed this application to handle real-life needs like managing customers, orders, returns, feedback, and tracking overall business performance ‚Äî all from one simple dashboard.

While working on it, I tried to include features that are usually found in modern business tools ‚Äî like login authentication, customer lifetime value, return logic, dashboards, payment simulation, and even WhatsApp support. Some parts are kept manual (like delivery status) because this is a project, not a live business with real delivery systems.

This project not only helped me improve my technical skills but also gave me confidence to think like a real developer ‚Äî how users interact, what data they need, and how to make the interface simple and useful. I also learned how important user experience and design are in making a project easy to use.

Overall, I really enjoyed building this system, and I believe it‚Äôs a strong example of what I‚Äôve learned so far in my training.
